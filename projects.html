          <p class="detail-tagline">
            Objective: Use project management tools to design a structured plan to grow awareness
            for a plant-subscription company.

              <h3>Project Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Office Green is a simulated project from the Google Project Management curriculum that
                focuses on defining a clear problem statement and turning it into a structured, trackable
                project. The goal is to increase brand awareness while staying within realistic time
                and resource constraints.
              </p>

              <h3>Role</h3>
              <p>
                As the project manager, I was responsible for clarifying goals, aligning with stakeholders,
                and designing a plan that could be handed off to a delivery team.
              </p>

              <h3>Key Deliverables</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Project charter and high-level business case</li>
                <li>Scope statement and S.M.A.R.T. goals for awareness growth</li>
                <li>Stakeholder register and RACI chart</li>
                <li>High-level timeline with milestones and dependencies</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Methods &amp; Tools</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Project initiation framework from Google PM program</li>
                <li>Stakeholder and communication planning</li>
                <li>Risk register and basic risk-response planning</li>
                <li>Gantt-style scheduling to visualize phases and milestones</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>What I Practiced</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Translating vague goals into measurable outcomes</li>
                <li>Balancing scope, time, and resources using the triple constraint</li>
                <li>Documenting assumptions and risks up front</li>
                <li>Communicating the project vision clearly to stakeholders</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Next Steps</h3>
              <p>
                As I continue the program, I plan to expand this case study by adding mock metrics
                (KPIs) and additional documentation such as a sample risk log and communication plan.

          <p class="detail-tagline">
            Objective: Plan the conversion of a retired middle school into a fully operational community
            center, including a library, garden, and support programs.

              <p>
                This conceptual project explores how to structure a community-focused initiative. The idea
                is to turn an unused school into a vibrant community hub that includes a public library,
                a community garden, flexible program spaces, and a staffing model that supports long-term
                operations.
              </p>

              <h3>Role</h3>
              <p>
                Acting as the project manager, I defined scope elements, success criteria, and timelines,
                while considering diverse stakeholders such as residents, local government, partners,
                and staff.

                This section is intentionally left flexible so I can plug in a real-world project as soon
                as the opportunity arises. Some ideas I’m considering:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Improving a store or team process (scheduling, onboarding, communication)</li>
                <li>Designing a customer experience improvement initiative</li>
                <li>Organizing a community-based event, workshop, or fundraiser</li>

              <h3>What I Want to Showcase</h3>
              <p>
                My goal for this future project is to demonstrate how I move from theory to practice:
                taking what I’m learning through the Merit America Google Project Management program
                and applying it in a real environment where people, time, and resources all matter.
