            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
              My name is <strong>Justin Okland</strong>, and I am an adaptable, people-focused leader with
              nearly a decade of management experience across wireless sales, customer service, retail,
              direct support, and hospitality. I am currently completing the
              <strong>Merit America Google Project Management</strong> program to expand my skill set and
              pursue a long-term career in project management.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my work history, I’ve built a reputation for strong problem-solving skills,
              calm leadership under pressure, and the ability to support teams through challenges.
              Whether managing sales teams, overseeing store operations, supporting individuals in
              direct-care environments, or running my own business, I approach every role with
              empathy, structure, and a people-first mindset.

          <article class="detail-card">
            <h2>Professional Background</h2>
            <p>
              I bring experience from management roles in environments including Walmart, OSL Wireless,
              Five Guys, and McDonald’s, where I supported teams, coached employees, resolved escalations,
              managed KPIs, oversaw inventory, and ensured smooth daily operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also founded and operated a luxury travel agency, where I built itineraries for high-end
              clients, negotiated partnerships, and managed all business operations. That experience
              strengthened my communication, vendor relations, scheduling, budgeting, and project
              coordination abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Across all roles, the common threads of my work include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Leading and motivating teams toward shared goals</li>
              <li>Coaching and supporting team members through obstacles</li>
              <li>Creating structure, improving processes, and solving problems</li>
              <li>Managing scheduling, staffing, planning, and communication</li>
              <li>Providing exceptional customer and client experiences</li>
            </ul>
          </article>

          <article class="detail-card">
            <h2>Creative Side: Music & Photography</h2>
            <p>
              Outside of project management, creativity plays a big role in my life. I’ve been
              playing the <strong>piano since I was a child</strong>, which taught me discipline,
              focus, and emotional expression. More recently, I’ve begun learning the <strong>guitar</strong>,
              expanding my love for music and challenging myself with something new.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve also started getting into <strong>photography</strong>, especially nature and landscape
              shots. Photography gives me a sense of calm and encourages me to slow down, observe,
              and appreciate details—skills that translate back into my work as a project manager.

            <h2>Where I’m Headed</h2>
            <p>
              My goal is to merge my leadership background, project management training, and creative
              problem-solving abilities to build a career in <strong>project or program management</strong>.
              I’m passionate about creating organized systems, improving processes, and helping teams
              do their best work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in continuous growth—professionally, creatively, and personally—and I’m excited
              for where this journey leads next.
